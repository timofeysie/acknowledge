Using Operators and Decision Constructs

*Using Operators and Decision Constructs* ---------------------

Question:
What is the result of executing the following fragment of code:  boolean b1 = false; 
boolean b2 = false; 
if (b2 != b1 = !b2){    
	System.out.println("true"); 
} else{    
	System.out.println("false"); 
}

Answer:
Note that  boolean operators have more precedence than =. (In fact, = has least precedence of all operators.)
so, in (b2 != b1 = !b2)  first b2 != b1 is evaluated which returns a value 'false'. So the expression becomes false = !b2. And this is illegal because false is a value and not a variable!
 
Had it been something like (b2 = b1 != b2) then it is valid because it will boil down to : b2 = false.
Because all an if() needs is a boolean, now b1 != b2 returns false which is a boolean and as b2 =  false is an expression and every expression has a return value (which is actually the Left Hand Side of the expression). Here, it returns false, which is again a boolean.

Note that return value of expression :  i = 10 , where i is an int, is 10 (an int).
Correct response: compile time error.
