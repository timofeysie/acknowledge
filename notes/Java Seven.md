Random Notes
- Initializer blocks get called everytime the class is constructed. The static block only gets called once, no matter how many objects of that type you create.
- Special non-capturing contructs like (?<=X) mean X, via zero-width positive lookbehind.
- Enhancements in Java 5: Generics, Enhanced for loop, Auto(un)boxing, Typesafe Enums, Varargs, Annotations
- Enhancements in Java 6: Collections framework, Webstart, Drag and drop, Instrumentation, i18n, I/O support, jar files, JDBC4
- Constant Interface Antipattern: putting static memebers into an interface and inherting that to leave of the class name of static methos.  So we have the static import.
- varags (variable arguments) are the elipses (...) part indicates that an array or a sequence of arguments may be used in its place.  It must be in the final argument position or a method signature.
- the compiler translates the varargs formal parameter into an array. 
- for each in example.  (Vector v) for (String s:v) {print(s);}
