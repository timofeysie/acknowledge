StringBuilder	append(boolean,char,char[],CharSequence,double,float,int,long,Object,String,StringBuffer)

There is no mention of byte here.  But if we try this:

		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello ");
		byte b = 1;
		sb.append(b);

It works anyhow.  What other things will work?  An array of ints?  No:

		int [] i = {1,2,3};
		sb.append(i);

This will append the hash code for the array.
