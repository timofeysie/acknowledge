# Acknowledge Code

Acknowledge is another word for hello.

## About the examples

Instead of creating examples called hello world, this repo usually goes just a little bit further, providing code examples and problem solutions.

It contains example code, test questions and general odds and ends that don't fit in other projects I maintain.

A lot of the code is from project active before the I came to focus on frontend development in 2013.

Similar to the code in this project, Plunker, Stackblitz, CodePen and other cloud based code solutions have been used for the same purpose.

## React examples

There are currently two React apps inside the examples/javascript directory.

- Vite vanilla JavaScript
- React TypeScript with Redux

These can both be run by navigating to their respective directories and then running `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` for the Vite app and  `npm start` for the TS app.

## Plunkers

In the spirit of keeping up with old acknowledgements, here is a list of some plunkers.

## Further work

GitHub is my primary portfolio of work, but I also have some live examples that are currently deployed.

However, deploying projects costs money, so most project that have at one point or another been available online are now not available.

Here is a list of projects and sites that are currently deployed.

## Live Examples

### [NextJS Blog using Markdown files](https://timothycurchod.com/)

The [project GitHub](https://github.com/timofeysie/nextjs-markdown-blog)

This is my personal developer blog.  Some of my work goes into the form of articles which may be helpful to others.  Much of the work I do exists in notes like these blogs, but it is only rarely that I edit and refine them into articles suitable for the blog.

## [Quaternary](https://github.com/timofeysie/quaternary)

This is a documentation project for all the other repositories contained in the timofeysie GitHub, as well as listing live samples for some of them.  It is a bit of an overlap with the goals of this project, so worth mentioning.
